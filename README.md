# Node.js REST API with no framework 

I've learned a lot from Traversy Media, including how to write the bones of a basic CRUD API. I know that in general people make complicated APIs, that are connected to databases such as MongoDB. But I wanted to learn the very basics without even a framework like Express. So I used a basic MVC design pattern here and used JSON files to store data. I've tested it with Talend, and it worked fine. I'm more like a front-end developer, but gosh I love the backend too at this point. We'll see if this passion is permanent as API projects become more and more complicated.

The data is not too dummy btw, I collected 30 JavaScript interview questions with answers, that I'm planning to make use of in a React application.
